# web-scraper

App that lets users view and leave comments on the latest news. But you're not going to actually write any articles; instead, you'll flex your **Mongoose and Cheerio** muscles to scrape news from another site.

Remember
 Run `npm init`. When that's finished, install and save these npm packages:
 
1. express

2. express-handlebars

3. mongoose

4. cheerio

5. axio
